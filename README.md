# IST256-Project

Instructions:
npm start
Access localhost:3000 from a web browser

Our application consists of the following pages:
-Homepage
-Careers
-Connections/Companies
-Contact
-Profile
-Login
-Create New Account
The way we approached working on this together was that initially each member focused on a single pageâ€™s HTML and CSS (and JS if utilized). Each member first contributed as so:
Elizabeth - Homepage
Kelvin - Profile
Nick - Careers
Caroline - Connections 
As the project went on, we collaborated more on all of the pages.
