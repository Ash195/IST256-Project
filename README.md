# IST256-Project

Instructions:
npm start
heroku open

Our application consists of the following:
-A Homepage
-A Profile page
-A Careers page
-A Connections page 
The way we approached working on this together, was that each member took charge of a pageâ€™s HTML and CSS (and JS if utilized). Each member contributed as so:
Elizabeth - Homepage
Kelvin - Profile
Nick - Careers
Caroline - Connections
